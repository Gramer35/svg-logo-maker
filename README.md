# svg-logo-maker

## Description

This project allows the user to create their very own custom SVG logo! The user can enter up to 3 characters and choose from a square, circle, or triangle. Along with the shape and text, the user is able to pick the color for their text and shape. This allows the user a quick logo on the go to use for their projects. We were able to accomplish this with the use of inquirer and object deconstruction. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![Logo](lib/images/logo.jpeg)
