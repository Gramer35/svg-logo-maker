# svg-logo-maker

## Description

This project allows the user to create their very own custom SVG logo! The user can enter up to 3 characters and choose from a square, circle, or triangle. Along with the shape and text, the user is able to pick the color for their text and shape. This allows the user a quick logo on the go to use for their projects. We were able to accomplish this with the use of inquirer and object deconstruction. 

## Usage

To use this project, user must install inquirer for the prompts and jest for the test. Once done, user must open integrated terminal of index.js and then enter 'node index.js'. After that it's as simple as responding to the prompts! To run the test, the user must enter 'npm run test'.
